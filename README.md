This is a simple messaging app built using Django, allowing users to send, receive, and manage messages within a web application.

Features:
- Send messages to users with different levels (e.g., success, error, info).
- Display messages in templates using Djangoâ€™s built-in messaging framework.
- Customize the storage backend for messages (default is session-based).
